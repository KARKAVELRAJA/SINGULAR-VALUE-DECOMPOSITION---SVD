# SINGULAR-VALUE-DECOMPOSITION---SVD

### IMPLEMENTATION OF IMAGE COMPRESSION USING SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION (SVD)

- The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix is a factorization of that matrix into three matrices
- It is a widely used technique to decompose a matrix into three component matrices, exposing many of the useful and interesting properties of the original matrix
- In this project, at first the image is created
- Then, the SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION (SVD) is computed
- Finally, Image Compression Activities are carried out using the SVD
